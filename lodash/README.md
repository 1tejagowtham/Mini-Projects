**************lodash*********

This description is about lodash folder.

In this project, I implemented some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular lodash.js library for ten methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

Inside _.js we have all those ten methods written inside an object.

'test' folder contains test cases written for each method.

Execution to check the correctness for each function written in _.js :

Type node test/[test_method.js] in the terminal

Eg: node test/clamp.js
